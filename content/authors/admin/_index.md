I'm John. I'm a scientific researcher with a doctorate in Meteorology from Iowa State University, Iowa, and 42 months' experience as a postdoctoral research position at CIMMS/NSSL in Oklahoma, USA.

I grew up in Stockton-on-Tees, northeastern England, and lived in Reading (England), Salt Lake City (Utah, USA), Ames (Iowa, USA), and Norman (Oklahoma, USA). 

Ask me about the following and I'll talk your ears off: politics and ethics, cricket, association football, philosophy, languages and accents, music (rock, metal, EDM, trippy), spiders, gambling statistics...


(call me "he")
